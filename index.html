        <p>Whichever way you look at it, in the decade and a half since its release, Boards Of Canada’s Warp debut has
          acquired a mythical prestige that transcends both the Sandison brothers’ original ambitions and the music’s
          own guileless outlook. Perhaps surprisingly for a record so fanatically adored, not even all the material
          on Music Has The Right To Children was new: ‘Turquoise Hexagon Sun’ had appeared on Hi Scores in 1996
          and on the collection Boc Maxima (released on the pair’s Music70 label), which also included ‘One Very
          Important Thought’, ‘Roygbiv’ and ‘Wildlife Analysis’. But where that record pulled together Boards Of
          Canada ephemera into a musically pleasing if conceptually underwhelming whole, Music Has The Right To
          Children was a unified work proper.
        </p>
        <p>Despite its name, Music… is about as grown-up as records get: an adult meditation on childhood, concerned with
          play, naïveté and nostalgia, all tinted with rosy pastoralism. But it’s also devilishly subtle, intricate and
          emotionally mature. That’s surprisingly rare in electronic music, most of which is concerned with the
          physicality of dance, intellectual weight, or the evocation of atmosphere rather than a holistic experience.
          By introducing themes of suppression, solitude and grief into Music…’s evocations of childhood, Boards of Canada
          created a record that was pretty but seldom precious, more faithful to experience than kitsch idealism.
          This ambiguity has endeared Music Has The Right To Children to its hordes of fans over time: as its listeners
          grew ever further away from the childhood it evoked, the album, bizarrely, became more relevant.
